# RevoBank API Documentation

## Overview

RevoBank API is a RESTful web service built with Flask to manage a banking system. This API enables features for user management, account management, and transaction management without relying on an SQL database. Instead, all data is stored and handled using in-memory models.

This project allows users to create and manage their bank accounts, track transactions, and interact with a clear API interface for seamless financial operations.
