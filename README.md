# RevoBank API Documentation

## Overview

RevoBank API is a RESTful web service built with Flask to manage a banking system. This API enables features for user management, account management, and transaction management without relying on an SQL database. Instead, all data is stored and handled via in-memory models. The API provides endpoints for creating users, managing their profiles, creating accounts, and handling transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

This project aims to help users easily create and manage their bank accounts, track transactions, and provide a clear interface for interacting with the system.

## Features Implemented

The RevoBank API includes the following features:

### **User Management:**

- **POST /users/register**: Allows the creation of a new user account.
- **GET /users/me**: Retrieves the profile of the currently logged-in user.
- **PUT /users/me**: Updates the profile information of the currently logged-in user.

### **Account Management:**

- **GET /accounts**: Retrieves a list of all accounts.
- **GET /accounts/:id**: Retrieves details of a specific account by its ID.
- **POST /accounts**: Creates a new account.
- **PUT /accounts/:id**: Updates details of an existing account.
- **DELETE /accounts/:id**: Deletes an account.

### **Transaction Management:**

- **GET /transactions**: Retrieves a list of all transactions.
- **GET /transactions/:id**: Retrieves details of a specific transaction by its ID.
- **POST /transactions**: Initiates a new transaction (deposit, withdrawal, or transfer).
